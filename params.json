All that is known about ThreeNumbers is that it takes three integers as input, and returns one of them\r\n\r\n1. By reading the code for ThreeNumbers, try to figure out what it does. Write some test code to see if you are right.\r\n\r\n2. Write and test a new method TwoNumbers, that does the same thing as ThreeNumbers, but now only for two numbers.\r\n\r\n3. Write and test a new method FourNumbers, that does the same thing as ThreeNumbers, but now for four numbers (tip – you can probably use the method TwoNumbers to make the code fairly short and easy).\r\n\r\n4. Rewrite ThreeNumbers to use the TwoNumbers method. What code do you like best – the original code or the new code?\r\n",
